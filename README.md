# ReleaseBuilder

This is a tool that uses XML files to publish releases. Probably could be done using make, 
but this uses XML which permits a much more tightly defined data, validation etc.

## Releasing release builder

publish the project using the profile that is appropriate; output will be in publish\release\platform so then copy the files to wherever on your local machine.

e.g.
copy /y I:\dev\ReleaseBuilder\publish\release
